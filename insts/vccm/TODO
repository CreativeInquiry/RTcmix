$$ filter information is tied into "ellset" and not the instrument ELL
$$ can't change ringdur but can change other params FILTSWEEP
# problem with reallocating memory FLANGE
$$ not sure if ringdur or damp is changing FREEVERB
$$ most pertinent parameters tied up in function call that occurs before the 
   sampling loop JCHOR
