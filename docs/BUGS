There's a problem with input sound files that have chunks outside of 
the header.  For example, some AIFF files (like some on the SampleCell
CDROMs) have comment chunks at the end of the file.  The RTcmix play
program correctly ignores these, as long as the duration declared in
the sound file header is correct.  But RTcmix itself happily slurps
in the comment chunk and interprets it as sound data.  This can easily
happen if you give STEREO a duration that causes it to read off the
end of the file.  You're likely to get a click.  Until we fix this,
it's best to adjust your script if you have source sounds like this,
using something like "dur = DUR() - 0.01".

load errors

When using a standalone instrument (eg., FMINST vs. CMIX) compiled via make
standalone_inst, you will see a warning message about the load directive in
a scorefile.  Don't worry, be happy.

gen2 is flakey. E.g....

makegen(2,2,4,0)
9.05 9.07 9.10 9.11 

If there's a space after "9.11", the job will bail with 
"fsize: You haven't allocated function 3 yet!" No space after: no problem.

problem in MIX (and no doubt any other processing inst)...
I want to take a stereo file and extract one channel into a mono file.
My score:
   rtsetparams(44100, 1)
   rtinput("stereofile"); rtoutput("monofile")
   MIX(0,0,DUR(),1, 0)
Segfaults at end. The reason: <in> float buffer new'd in MIX ctor
is sized as MAXBUF, which uses rtsetparams chan arg (1 in this case),
NOT inputchans (2 in this case) inst member. So <in> is overwritten.

Problem with Irix MIPSPro compiler declaring float arrays on the stack,
if sized by a variable instead of a constant. This was happening in all
insts that take input from a buffer. Solution was to dynamically allocate
the insts' private input buffer on construction of the inst. But this
really chews up memory fast for some scores, so it's not the way to go.

Spurious "... is an undefined function or Instrument" error msgs from Minc.
When a Minc function happens to return -1 (as trunc() does in STRUM9.sco),
parse_dispatch interprets that as an error code from checkfuncs, and later
from rtdispatch. Needs a minor redesign.
