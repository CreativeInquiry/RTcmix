=head1 NAME

gen24 - make a function with straight line segments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<makegen>(I<table_number>, 24, I<table_size>,
I<time1>, I<value1>, I<time2>, I<value2>, ... I<timeN>, I<valueN>)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Call L<makegen|makegen> from a script with a I<function_type> of 24 to
make a function table with any number of straight line segments.

If you want to use this to make table number 1 -- for an amplitude
envelope, for example -- you may find L<setline|setline> more convenient.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item I<table_number>

The numeric ID for the function table.

Normally the table will be rescaled to fit between -1 and 1.
Put a negative sign before the number to prevent this.

=item I<table_size>

The size of the function table: how many values it stores.

=item I<timeN>

=item I<valueN>

Pairs of I<time>,I<value> arguments define points throught which
straight line segments are drawn.

Successive times must be in ascending order.  To make an instantaneous
change of amplitude, use the same time for two adjacent pairs.

The shape created by the table is scaled to fit the duration of each
note that follows.

=head1 EXAMPLES

   makegen(1, 24, 1000, 0,0, 1,1, 10,0)

makes a quick ramp from 0 to 1, followed by a much slower ramp from 1 to 0.

=head1 NOTES

L<Gen 18|gen18> works just like gen 24, except that it never normalizes
the table to fit between -1 and 1.

L<Gen 6|gen6> works just like gen 24, but is subtly different.  (We're
not really sure why both of these exist...)
