This directory contains a preliminary documentation system for RTcmix.
A lot is missing, but you still may find it useful.

   make all install

(This is done from the top-level Makefile.)

This will put html documentation in RTcmix/docs/html.  Just point
your browser to the index.html file in that directory.

This also puts man pages in RTcmix/docs/man.  Add this directory
to your MANPATH to use them.  In bash, put something like this in
your .profile (or wherever you put such things):

   MANPATH="$MANPATH:/usr/local/rtcmix/docs/man"
