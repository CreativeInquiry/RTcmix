=head1 NAME

system - perform any system call

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<system>(I<command_line>)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a way to do from an RTcmix script most anything you could
do from the shell.

This is most useful in scores for older disk-based Cmix instruments,
for reasons discussed below.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item I<command_line>

A double-quoted string giving a system call to perform.

=back

=head1 RETURNS

The return value of the system call.

=head1 EXAMPLES

   system("rm -f pvoctest.snd")
   system("sfcreate -c -s sun pvoctest.snd")
   output("pvoctest.snd")
   input("foo.aif")
   pvoc(0, 0, 20, 0, 1024, 2048, 150, 100, 0, 0)
   system("rescale -r pvoctest.snd")

Use B<system> to call the L<sfcreate|sfcreate> command-line utility to
create an empty sound file.  This is required by disk-based Cmix instruments.
Use B<system> to delete any existing "pvoctest.snd" file, because
L<sfcreate|sfcreate> complains if a file already exists.
Finally, use B<system> to call the L<rescale|rescale> command-line utility.

=head1 NOTES

The call is performed during the initialization portion of an RTcmix
script that contains calls to real-time instruments.  That is, it
happens while RTcmix is parsing the script, but before it has run any
of the instruments called in the script.  This means you can't use
B<system> to rescale a sound file generated by instruments in the
script, because the file won't contain anything yet when B<system>
does its work.

This is in contrast to the way the older disk-based Cmix instruments
work: they execute as they are encountered in the script.  That's
why it works to run L<pvoc|pvoc> and then rescale the file.
