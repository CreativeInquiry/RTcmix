This is an example of an "instrument" that doesn't make any sound. Instead,
if returns a number to Minc. This is a way to add functions to Minc that
you're missing.

Change these files...

1) In Makefile, set "NAME" to the name of your .c file.

2) Change package.conf so that it points to the "makefile.conf" in the
   RTcmix distribution. (If you have a lot of instruments in one directory,
   they can share one package.conf. Put it in the directory containing all
   the instrument directories, and change their Makefiles to
   "include ../package.conf". See insts.std for an example.)

3) In "test.sco", change the load statement so that it loads the shared
   lib in your src directory. For example, if your .c file is called
   "myfuncs.c" and its full path is "/home/bubba/src/myfuncs/myfuncs.c",
   then the load statement you must put in all scores that use your
   functions is:  load("/home/bubba/src/myfuncs/libmyfuncs.so").
