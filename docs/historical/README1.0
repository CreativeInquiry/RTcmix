[NOTE:  This is the older RTcmix1.0 README -- read the README2.0 file
 first...]


Hey folks!

I guess this is the "beta" version of RTcmix, complete with real-time 
signal-processing, scheduling on-the-fly via a TCP/IP socket, and (of
course!) all other sorts of cool stuff.  Dave Topper and I
managed to fix most of the bugs with the preliminary version,
and this seems reasonably stable.  We still plan to add a
bit more, so it may shift around slightly in the next few
months.  It runs all the older CMIX routines ok, I think, if
you use the correct flags, etc. in the Makefiles.  The only
hard-wired constraint that I know of right now is that we have
an upper bound of 10000 makegens that can be instantiated in
any given run.  Of course this number can be changed, and we'll
make it dynamically allocable in the very near future.

Build it by typing "make" in the top-level directory.  "make clean"
strips it down to the source again for re-building.


Some useful info:

Running RTcmix instruments:

  [NOTE to current users of RTcmix2.0:  The methodology of calling
   RTcmix/CMIX instruments has changed to take advantage of the new
   DSO capabilities (using the "load()" directive in scores).  The following
   will still work, but the better way to do it is to invoke the base
   CMIX executables by just typing "CMIX < score.file" or "cmix < score.file"
   and using "load()" in the scorefiles to dynamically load the instruments
   you need.  See the README in the insts/ subdirectory for more information.]

You can run RTcmix instruments (there the ones in CAPITAL letters
in the insts directory) in three modes --

1.
	INSTRUMENT < score.file

will run the same as "normal" cmix, only will realize sound in
real-time.  Processing will start after the scorefile is completely
parsed, and will finish at the end of the last scheduled event.

2.
	INSTRUMENT -i < score.file

will run in "interactive" mode.  It will parse the entire scorefile and
schedule any events found, but will then continue to listen for sockdata
structures through TCP/IP socket number 1102.  Often I use a scorefile that
only contains some initialization commands (such as rtsetparams(), maybe
some makegens, etc.) and then do the rest through the socket.  You can
also use this mode to "play along" with a set scorefile.  NOTE:  you
*must* have an rtsetparams() in the scorefile to run in this mode!  Some
important variables (SR, RTBUFSAMPS, etc.) won't get set otherwise.

3.
	INSTRUMENT -i -n

will start the instrument running and will listen for all data (including
rtsetparams() info) through the socket.  Your client application has
to send rtsetparams() before any audio processing can occur.  It will not
parse a scorefile at all, even if the " < score.file" is included.


  [NOTE:  Item 4 is actually new to RTcmix2.0, but it seemed appropriate
   to include it here.]

4.
	INSTRUMENT -i -n -c

will do all of the above stuff, plus engage "continuous update" mode,
allowing instruments designed with the rtupdate() feature to change
parameters as they execute.  The basic WAVETABLE and FMINST instruments
show how this can be done.


Each instrument in the insts directory has a number of sample scorefiles, 
and there are a few sample client applications in the interface directory
-- see the README there for how to run them.


MINC Level:

rtsetparams() --  This replaces the output() call in a scorefile,
	it sets up the convertors, etc.  p[0] is the sampling
	rate and p[1] is the number of output channels.  p[2]
	(optional) will set the size of the i/o buffers used by
	RTcmix.  The default is 8192 samples, but it can be set
	as low as 256 and things still work.  The trade-off is
	available computation time vs. interactive latency --
	you will have to experiment until you find what works
	and what doesn't.  p[2] does not necessarily have to
	be a power of 2.

rtinput() -- This replaces the input() call in the score, and
	has the same basic operation with respect to existing
	soundfiles.  However, if the filename is "AUDIO", then
	it will set up for real-time input from the mic, line
	or digital input ports.  The default values are to read
	sound from the mic in stereo.  It uses the same sampling
	rate as set by rtsetparams().  For example:

	rtsetparams(44100, 2)
	rtinput("AUDIO")

	will read from the microphone at 44.1k SR, reading
	a stereo signal

	rtinput("AUDIO", "LINE", 1)

	will read from the line input at 44.1k, mono.
	(p[1] and p[2] are both optional)

	NOTE:  I wrote this under IRIX 6.2, using the old SGI
	API for setting audio devices.  We need to change this
	to conform to the new way of selecting which audio resource
	to use -- I think "MIC" will tend to read from the 'camera
	mic' on 02s running 6.3.  Arg!

rtoutput() -- This will write an aiff audio file as it creates
	the sound.  For example:

	rtoutput("cool.snd") 

	will produce an aiff file called "cool.snd" in the current 
	directory; with no "gaps" or bobbles that might be present 
	because of overloading in real-time (i.e. the writing of the 
	file can occur out of real-time and still produce a continuous
	soundfile).  rtoutput() is destructive, so it checks and
	exits with a warning if it finds an existing file of
	the same name.  Note that this doesn't need "sfcreate"
	or anything like that to work, but of course it only
	writes integer soundfiles.

	I'm not sure how well this works in interactive mode.


INSTRUMENT Level:

rtsetinput(), rtsetoutput() -- These replace setnote(), third param
	is a pointer to the current instrument rather than a
	CMIX filedesc.

rtgetin() -- replaces bgetin(), call it once at the beginning
	of each "chunk" of samples to compute.

rtaddout() -- replaces ADDOUT, only with 1 param (the output array).

rtprofile() and RT_INTRO() -- these work in the same was as profile()
	and UG_INTRO, only for real-time instruments.

  [NOTE: new to RTcmix2.0...]

rtupdate() -- this allows instruments to change parameters as they
	are executing, this effecting continuous control.  Several examples
	in the RTcmix2.0.interfaces.tar.gz package show how this is done.


I also added a new gen routine, gen 25, that creates Hanning or
Hamming windows.  it has only 1 p-field after the 3 setup p-fields,
a "1" creates a Hanning window and a "2" creates a Hamming window,
i.e.

	makegen(1, 25, 1000, 1) /* Hanning window */
	makegen(1, 25, 1000, 2) /* Hamming window */


  [NOTE: new to RTcmix2.0...]

Luke Dubois wrote gen 20, which will set up different random number
distributions.  Like gen 25, it takes a single argument after the
npoints parameter.  The arguments are:

     /* fills a gen with random numbers b/t 0 and 1 --
      * the argument is the distribution type:
      * 0 = even distribution
      * 1 = low weighted linear distribution
      * 2 = high weighted linear distribution
      * 3 = triangle linear distribution
      * 4 = gaussian distribution
      * 5 = cauchy distribution
      *
      * by r. luke dubois - CMC/CU, 1998.
      *
      * distribution equations adapted from dodge and jerse.
      *
      */



There are a lot of sample instruments (plus a bunch of older CMIX
routines) in the insts directory -- see the README there for
a brief listing.  We'll be adding more!


The version here compiles on SGIs under IRIX 6.2, Dave Topper
has a Linux port of this if anyone wants it (topper@panix.com).

Let me know what you think!
